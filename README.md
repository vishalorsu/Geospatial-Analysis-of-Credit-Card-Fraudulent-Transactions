Geospatial Analysis of Credit Card Fraudulent Transactions
Project Description
This project focuses on improving the detection and prevention of credit card fraud by integrating geospatial analysis with traditional and advanced machine learning techniques. Our approach leverages the Databricks unified analytics platform for data processing, visualization, and machine learning.

System Requirements
Core Platform: Databricks for a unified analytics experience integrating data processing, machine learning, and collaborative workflows.
Tools: Apache Spark with Python (PySpark) for distributed computing and efficient data transformations.
Machine Learning: Spark MLlib for tasks such as regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
How to Run
Requirements
A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.) to access Databricks.
An internet connection for Databricks, which is a cloud-based platform.
Step 1: Setting Up Databricks
Create a Databricks Account:

Visit Databricks and sign up for an account.
Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the account setup.
Create a Workspace:

Once logged in, create a new workspace from the Databricks dashboard.
Provide a name for your workspace and configure any additional settings as necessary.
Step 2: Configuring the Databricks Environment
Create a Cluster:

In your Databricks workspace, navigate to the "Clusters" section and click "Create Cluster."
Choose a cluster name and select the appropriate Databricks runtime that supports PySpark and Spark MLlib (13.3 LTS ML Cluster is recommended).
Configure the cluster's hardware settings as required and start the cluster.
Install Libraries:

While your cluster is running, go to the "Libraries" tab within the cluster configuration.
Install necessary Python libraries such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn. Ensure that pyspark and spark-mllib are also included.
Step 3: Accessing and Running Notebooks
Create a Notebook:

In your workspace, click "Create" and select "Notebook."
Assign a name to your notebook and connect it to your cluster by selecting the cluster from the drop-down menu.
Import Project Files:

Import our pre-existing notebooks file to the project by uploading files directly to the workspace.
Running the Notebook:

Open your notebook and run the cells sequentially to begin processing data, visualizing results, and training machine learning models using PySpark and Spark MLlib.
Dataset
Link: Kaggle Dataset
Download the dataset from the link and upload it to the Databricks database.
